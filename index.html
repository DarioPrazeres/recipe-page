          Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).

          <strong>Make the crust:</strong> Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a
          medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the
          food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or
          10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust
          down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum
          foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you
          prepare the filling.

      <div class="p-1">

          <strong>Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the
          cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth
          and
          creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined.
          On
          medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg
          is
          incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it
          cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.
        </p>

          <strong>Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</strong> Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in
          your
          roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the
          water
          is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the
          crust.
          Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan.
          Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in
          the
          oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)
        </p>
      </div>


      <div class="p-1">

        <p>
          Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it’s done, the center of the
          cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door
          slightly.
          Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and
          water
          bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4
          hours
          or overnight.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="p-1">
        <span>6</span>
        <p>
          Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a
          clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water
          between each slice.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="p-1">
        <span>7</span>
        <p>
          Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5
          days.
